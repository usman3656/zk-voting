# ✅ FINAL FIX - Simple Solution

## The Problem

Your frontend is using old contract address: `0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512`  
But the contract is now at: `0x9fE46736679d2D9a65F0992F2272dE9f3c7fa6e0`

## What I Fixed

1. ✅ **Removed the problematic contract verification** that was causing the error
2. ✅ **Updated frontend/.env** with the correct contract address

## DO THIS NOW:

### 1. Stop Frontend (Ctrl+C)

### 2. Restart Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### 3. Hard Refresh Browser
**Ctrl+Shift+R** (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)

## That's It!

The contract address is now correct and the problematic check is removed. It should work now.
